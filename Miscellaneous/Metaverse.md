# Metaverse: What You Know vs What You Don't

The development of technology and the need to be free from social norms has given birth to the concept of metaverse. 
Making use of Web 3.0 and blockchain technology, it is capable of creating a three dimensional virtual environment, similar to reality. 
A digital world where our imaginations can come to life, the metaverse is one of the most anticipated technologies that can revolutionize our lifestyle.

In this environment, people from all corners of the world are able to interact with each other, as if they were standing next to each other, using avatars. 
The concept of avatars has been present for a long time. The idea to create and manage a digital character, who portrays yourself, has been used in most games 
as well as several other technologies. 
In the metaverse, you can use this avatar to perform different actions, experience the unexperienced and live a completely different lifestyle. 
You can even conduct transactions in the metaverse using different cryptocurrencies and non-fungible tokens(NFT). 
The usage of NFTs and cryptocurrencies have been increasing exponentially throughout the past few years. 
The rise of metaverse will only lead to an increase in demand for cryptocurrency and NFTs. 
As such this is another sector that will experience rapid growth. Live public events, movies, games and such are some other areas which will benefit from metaverse. 
The ability to shoot certain visually stunning shots can certainly improve movie experiences and to play as the main character has been the dream of many gamers worldwide. 

## The Dark Side Of Metaverse
From the info given above, metaverse might seem like a paradise to people. However, it certainly comes with it's own drawbacks. 
Metaverse is a virtual world where you are free to do whatever you wish. But is that the complete truth? Or is it just propaganda from the MNCs? 
Metaverse, like any other digital software, will obviously keep a history of what we do with it. This data is not under our control. 
The MNCs will make use of this data to keep tabs on our choice of lifestyle, influence our decisions and if necessary, take action against us if they wish to. 
In the past, companies like Meta(previously known as Facebook) have been accused of illegal collection of data from its users. 
So it is reasonable to assume that they may repeat it considering the fact that they have taken an obsession with the creation of the metaverse. 
And what stops them from doing so? They have the power and the ability. Are we just supposed to disclose our private matters to them as they wish? 
Unless there are certain lawful constraints on these MNCs, we will never feel safe or secure in using such products. 
The metaverse can also lead to a lot more cases of virtual crimes. People can easily misuse the freedom given by the metaverse.
This is not a small issue. We must be cautious in dealing with this matter.

## Conclusion
The concept of metaverse is both fascinating as well as terrifying at the same time. 
The positive, as well as negative implications are many, and the impact it causes on humans and society, in general, is immense. 
Yet only through sacrifice can we achieve progress. And this paradox is what helps us grow. 
Thus it all comes down to us and the choices we make.
